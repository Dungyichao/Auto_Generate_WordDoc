# Auto Generate Word Document with Excel Chart and Email Report
This tutorial will show you how to use C# to generate word document or PDF file with some Excel charts in it, and email this report to who is concerned. The motivation of this tutorial is because I don't want to use some third party library which cost or maybe free but with watermark on your report. 

# 1. What is the Goal <br />
Let's take a look on what kind of document (.docx or .pdf) we are going to generate using C# Console Application.<br />

<br />
Apperntly, there is title, some contents, some pictures, and some charts in the report. That is what we are going to achieve using program.

# 2. The Idea in behind <br />
We will use C# program to use Microsoft Office 2010 Word and Excel to generate report for us, so you will need Office 2010 installed in your PC.
